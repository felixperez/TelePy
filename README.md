# TelePy
Just telegram bots written in python.

 What we need?
    -First of all:
        We works under python2.7, i'm not sure if you can use pyTelegramBotAPI with python3 but, for the moment, we wouldn't have any                 problem.
      Install pyTelegramBotAPI from eternoir --> https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI
      Follow the link and install it.
